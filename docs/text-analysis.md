# Text analysis

Three things you often need next to a search box, none of which is a ranking function:
near-duplicate detection, keyword extraction, and classification. All of them are in the
core package and none of them needs an index — except where a corpus makes the result
better.

- **Lexical similarity** (`LexiSharp.Similarity`) — pairwise token-set measures (Jaccard,
  Sørensen–Dice) over the library tokenizer, a `pg_trgm`-style character trigram similarity,
  and a rolling Levenshtein edit distance.
- **Keyword extraction** (`LexiSharp.Keywords`) — a corpus-backed **TF-IDF** extractor
  (demotes corpus-frequent words) and a graph-based **TextRank** extractor (weighted
  co-occurrence graph + PageRank), both deterministic and tokenizer-configurable.
- **Classification** (`LexiSharp.Classification`) — multinomial Naive Bayes with Laplace
  smoothing, or Complement Naive Bayes for imbalanced labels, behind a dedicated
  `ITextClassifier` interface, with incremental `Learn`/`Unlearn` for labelled documents that
  arrive over time.

## Lexical similarity and keyword extraction

Pairwise similarity for near-duplicate detection and record de-duplication — token-set
measures over the library tokenizer, `pg_trgm`-style trigrams, and Levenshtein:

```csharp
using LexiSharp.Similarity;

bool duplicate = LexicalSimilarity.Jaccard(stored, incoming) > 0.5;
double fuzzy   = LexicalSimilarity.Trigram("kubernetes cluster", "kubernetes clusters");
int edits      = LevenshteinDistance.Distance("kitten", "sitting"); // 3
```

Keyword extraction pulls the representative terms out of a text. TF-IDF becomes corpus-aware
when built over an `ITextIndex`; TextRank needs no corpus at all:

```csharp
using LexiSharp.Keywords;

IKeywordExtractor tags = new TfIdfKeywordExtractor(someIndex, StopWordTokenizer);
IKeywordExtractor graph = new TextRankKeywordExtractor(StopWordTokenizer); // co-occurrence + PageRank

foreach (var keyword in graph.Extract(document.Text, topN: 5))
    Console.WriteLine($"{keyword.Term}: {keyword.Score:F3}");
```

## Classification

```csharp
using LexiSharp.Classification;

var classifier = new NaiveBayesClassifier();
classifier.Train(trainingDocuments); // requires a non-null SearchDocument.Category

foreach (var prediction in classifier.Predict("i cannot connect to the internet"))
    Console.WriteLine($"{prediction.Category}: {prediction.Probability:P}");
```

The classifier is a `IWeightedPredictor` too (`classifier is IWeightedPredictor`): a
spell-corrected token can carry less evidence than an exact match by passing
`WeightedToken`s directly. `Predict`/`PredictBest` accept a set of `excludedCategories` to
hide hot categories at runtime without retraining (probabilities renormalize over the rest).

### Incremental learning

`NaiveBayesClassifier` is also an `IIncrementalTextClassifier` (`classifier is
IIncrementalTextClassifier`), for labelled documents that arrive over time:

```csharp
// Adding one document. A model built this way is indistinguishable from one handed the whole
// corpus: same vocabulary, same per-class term counts, same document frequencies, same priors.
classifier.Learn(new SearchDocument("9", "package never arrived", Category: "Shipping"));

// Retracting one. Exactly undoes a Learn of the same document, and retires the category once its
// last document is gone — so a model can be built up and taken back down without ever retraining.
classifier.Unlearn(document);
```

Parity with `Train` is the contract, and it is tested under all twelve `NaiveBayesOptions`
combinations rather than only the defaults, because parity that holds only on the defaults is not
parity. Learning the same document twice weighs twice as much, matching two copies in the corpus.

`Unlearn` is arithmetic, not bookkeeping: it removes one document from the category and subtracts
that text's contribution, and it does not check that the text was ever learned. Tracking which
documents went in would cost memory proportional to the corpus, where the model itself is
proportional to the vocabulary. So unlearning something never seen is well-defined rather than an
error — the class loses a document of prior and nothing else, because there is nothing else to
subtract. Callers who mean "retract exactly what I added" should track it themselves; callers who
mean "this category has one document fewer" can just call it.

`Train` must not overlap any `Predict`; concurrent `Predict` calls are safe. `Learn` and `Unlearn`
are mutations and are not safe alongside either.

### What incremental learning costs

Measured on 12 logical processors, 10 000 documents of 30 tokens each over 5 categories, medians
of 7 rounds.

| Operation | Cost |
|---|---|
| `Train` 10 000 documents from cold | 67.9 ms |
| `Learn` the same 10 000 onto a warm model, 1st pass | 49.6 ms (0.730x) |
| `Learn` the same 10 000 onto a warm model, 2nd pass | 48.5 ms (0.713x) |
| one `Learn` | 0.90 µs |

The incremental pass is *cheaper* than the batch it replaces, which is the point: `Learn` does not
build a vocabulary set alongside the counts the way `Train` does, it derives the vocabulary size
from the counts already there. One `Learn` is ~75 000x cheaper than one retrain on this corpus,
which is the entire argument for having it.
## What the incremental and reinforced members cost

Measured on 12 logical processors, 10 000 documents of 30 tokens each over 5 categories, medians of
7 rounds.

| Operation | Cost |
|---|---|
| `Train` 10 000 documents from cold | 67.9 ms |
| `Learn` the same 10 000 onto a warm model, 1st pass | 49.6 ms (0.730x) |
| `Learn` the same 10 000 onto a warm model, 2nd pass | 48.5 ms (0.713x) |
| one `Learn` | 0.90 µs |

The incremental pass is *cheaper* than the batch it replaces, which is the point: `Learn` does not
build a vocabulary set alongside the counts the way `Train` does, it derives the vocabulary size
from the counts already there. One `Learn` is ~75 000x cheaper than one retrain on this corpus,
which is the entire argument for having it.

Concurrency, 2 s windows with 8 readers and 2 writers (one on the reinforcement ledger, one calling
`Learn`/`Unlearn`):

| | Reads | Failures |
|---|---|---|
| unwrapped, run 1 | 5 188 591 | 8 (0.00 %) |
| unwrapped, run 2 | 6 826 690 | 6 659 (0.10 %) |
| unwrapped, run 3 | 6 657 330 | 667 (0.01 %) |
| wrapped, 3 runs | ~2.6 M | 0 |

The bare failure counts are erratic because a race only sometimes lands, and they will not
reproduce on other hardware; the qualitative result will. Read-path cost of the lock came out at
0.986x / 1.051x / 1.057x / 0.975x / 1.043x across five runs — straddling 1.0, so the uncontended
read lock is not measurably expensive here, though it is not free either.
